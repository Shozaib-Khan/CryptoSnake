# Crypto Snake

A modern, fast-paced take on the classic arcade game "Snake", built with Next.js and React. Navigate the ever-shrinking arena, collect crypto coins to grow your snake, and aim for the high score!

## How to Play

- **Desktop:** Use the **Arrow Keys** or **WASD** keys to control the snake's direction.
- **Mobile:** **Swipe** in the direction you want the snake to move.
- **Objective:** Collect the cryptocurrency icons to score points. The more you eat, the longer your snake gets, and the smaller the game board becomes!
- **Game Over:** The game ends if you collide with the walls or run into your own tail. The game is won if you reach the maximum score of 100.

## Scoring

Different cryptocurrencies are available to collect:
- **Bitcoin (BTC):** +1 point
- **Ethereum (ETH):** +1 point
- **Sonic (SONIC):** +1 point
- **1inch (1INCH):** +1 point
